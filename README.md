# pallet-contracts test site

This repo hosts tests for `pallet-contracts`.

# Preparations

For running this test suite you would need to have:

1. A nightly rust compiler equipped with the `wasm32-unknown-unknown` target.

    The easiest way to install it is with `rustup`. Please see https://rustup.rs.

    ```shell
    rustup toolchain install nightly
    rustup update
    rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown --toolchain nightly
    ```

    Also, you might need to put cargo's bin directory on PATH. You can typically do it by executing:

    ```shell
    source ~/.cargo/env
    ```

2. yarn.

    Read on how to install it [here](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/).


3. wasm-prune

    ```shell
    cargo install pwasm-utils-cli --bin wasm-prune
    ```

4. wabt

    You can try to look it up in the package manager for your system or
    build it yourself.

    Please see https://github.com/WebAssembly/wabt for details.

# Running

This repo depends on submomdules, make sure you have them:

```
git submodule update --init
```

Then make sure that you built all artifacts required for running the tests by invoking

```
./build.sh
```

To run the tests, launch the substrate node locally and run

```
yarn && yarn upgrade && yarn test
```

## Using a Docker image of Substrate for testing

To run this tests, you need to run a local Substrate on port `ws://127.0.0.1:9944`. The other alternative is to use one of the Docker images that are being automatically generated with every update to the master branch and published https://hub.docker.com/r/parity/substrate/.

The script to run this container is `docker-compose.yml` file in the root of this repository.

Before you can run this script, you need to install Docker and 'Docker Compose' on your machine.
Please follow the steps described here (including the prerequisites): https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/

Usage:
1. BUILD: Run `docker-compose pull && docker-compose up` to pull the latest docker imaged and run the Docker image of the latest Subtrate master.
2. INFO: Run `docker ps` to get a list of Docker containers running in the background including their mapped ports on localhost
3. QUIT: Run `docker-compose down` to stop and remove all running containers.

Provided endpoint for localhost: Substrate Master ws://127.0.0.1:9944/
